# mini-message-board

A fun Express project that uses the EJS templating engine to create a simple message board! 
This project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern and was built to practice Express fundamentals and back-end web development.

## Reflections
This project was an amazing way to start using Express and the EJS templating engine. Not only was this project small in scope, it was also very simple. With only a few pages and features in total, the project was kept simple and manageable at all times without being overwhelming. By keeping the scope small, I was able to focus on creating quality, scalable code in Express while following the best practices.

This is a short and sweet project, so there isn't much for me to say except that it was a great learning opportunity. Express, while minimal, is really awesome and takes away much of the repetitive coding in vanilla Node. It was also cool to see the power of templating engines and why many big companies utilize them. As of right now, back-end development is manageable and I enjoy the seamless transition it has been thanks to Node.js and its JavaScript syntax. All in all: a great project and I'll be moving on to the next one!
